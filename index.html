               I've been playing Destiny 2 on PC since 2019. Every week, five friends
               and I get together and complete raids. I enjoy the lore and story elements
               of the game along with coming up with my own builds. Destiny 2 is currently
               the game I play the most. A new expansion is coming on on February 22nd called
               Witch Queen and I'm very excited to play it! Developer is Bungie.

               I originally played the Mass Effect Series when it released on Xbox 360 in 2007, 2010 and 2012.
               These games were my first experience with an RPG and I fell in love. I can remember playing these
               games through multiple times. When the remastered triology was released on steam last year,
               I replayed them all over again and remembered why I loved the games so much. Developer is Bioware.

               This is a game that I just recently started to play. The game is still in Early Release, but I've
               already been very impressed with the quality and content. It's a game that uses classes and rules from
               DnD. There are tons of options for roleplaying, thus giving it a significant amount of replayability.
               Developer is Larian Studios.

               I played this game frequently when I was in Grad School. It's an rpg style game that took me over
               a year to complete. There was just so much to do! The game also released two great DLC's called
               "Hearts of Stone" and "Blood and Wine" that added hours of fantastic content. Developer is CD projekt
               Red.

               I played this game on PC upon its release. It had a bit of a rocky start, especially on console,
               but I've really enjoyed the game. I feel like some of the criticism it got was a bit too harsh.
               Another great RPG from CD projekt Red.
